# 🕳️ Pothole Detection Using Image-Based Data Mining

A comprehensive image processing pipeline developed to detect potholes in road images without using pre-trained models. This project was built as part of a 2nd-year AI & DS course at Shiv Nadar University, Chennai.

## 🚀 Features

- Manual grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding
- Morphological operations (open, close) to clean binary images
- Contour detection & filtering based on:
  - Area
  - Perimeter
  - Circularity
  - Aspect ratio
  - Extent
  - Texture variation
- Edge analysis using Canny edge detection
- Composite scoring system for pothole confidence
- Visual output with pothole contours and scores

## 🧠 Why Manual Implementation?

- Educational value: Understand how each algorithm works internally
- Avoid dependency on OpenCV for core functions
- Transparent, interpretable workflow
- Allows fine-tuning of parameters at each step
